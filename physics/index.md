## Overview

The **AxoDen Physics Library** curates ongoing research and conceptual work emerging from **AxoDen Labs**, uniting physics, mathematics, cognition, and engineering into transparent, physically grounded intelligence frameworks.

Each publication explores a different layer of the **Helix⁴** feedback architecture — where physical law defines what is possible, mathematics proves what is valid, cognition perceives what is true, and engineering builds what is real.

## Current Papers

### [AxoDen Physics: Foundations of Physics-Constrained Intelligence](/physics/mypaper)
Introduces the AxoDen Physics framework — where gravity, entanglement, and thermodynamic constraints model the emergence of reasoning fields. Establishes the **AxoDen Field Equation** and **Helix⁴** feedback model.

---

### [Helix⁴ Feedback Architecture](/physics/helix4)
*(Coming Soon)* — A deep dive into the recursive 4-layer feedback model governing AxoDen’s self-consistent reasoning loop: **Physics → Mathematics → Cognition → Engineering**.

---

### [Quantum-Inspired Reasoning Networks](/physics/qirn)
*(In Preparation)* — Explores distributed agent coherence, entanglement-inspired negotiation, and information topology for non-local reasoning systems.
