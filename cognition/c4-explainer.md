## Abstract

C4 defines cognition as a system with **four measurable dimensions** and a **load modulation factor** governing how effectively reasoning operates under stress, ambiguity, and resource constraints.

It provides the backbone for explainable intelligence by ensuring systems can:

- Inspect their reasoning state
- Express uncertainty and confidence
- Adapt modes based on load
- Produce cognitive traces
- Remain bound by complexity and information integrity constraints

This page presents the *conceptual architecture only*.  
Mathematical forms are reserved for protected research disclosures.

## Executive Summary

C4 asserts that intelligence requires:

- **Awareness of cognitive state**
- **Visibility of uncertainty**
- **Controlled adaptation under load**
- **Justifiable, traceable reasoning steps**

In AxoDen, introspection is not a side-channel — it is part of the computation.

## 1 · C4 Dimensions

C4 tracks four cognitive properties during reasoning:

| Dimension | Meaning |
|---|---|
Information Processing (IP) | Precision and relevance of input handling |
Scope Flexibility (SF) | Ability to adjust context boundaries and perspective |
Cognitive Flexibility (CF) | Ability to shift thinking strategies or modes |
Abstraction Level (AL) | Ability to generalize, conceptualize, and compress ideas |

These dimensions form a **cognitive state vector**, used to monitor, evaluate, and guide reasoning behavior.

---

## 2 · Cognitive Load & Modulation (β)

Reasoning efficiency changes under load.  
C4 introduces a **load factor** that dynamically adjusts cognitive behavior based on:

- Stress signals
- Uncertainty pressure
- Resource usage
- Context switching cost
- Time/latency constraints

Systems must *detect*, *adjust*, and *declare* mode changes instead of silently degrading.

---

## 3 · Collective Cognition

C4 scales to multi-agent systems by balancing:

- Alignment (shared goals & invariants)
- Complementarity (non-redundant cognitive capabilities)
- Diversity (multiple reasoning pathways)
- Stress penalties (over-stretch and overload)

Aim: multiple perspectives that converge coherently.

---

## 4 · Cognitive Invariants

| Invariant | Requirement |
|---|---|
Cognitive trace | Every decision must include introspective metadata |
Uncertainty duty | Confidence, ambiguity, and bounds must be surfaced |
Provenance | Assumptions, evidence, and transformations exposed |
Complexity compliance | No silent computational escalation |
Information consistency | No unexplained loss or distortion of meaning |
Mode legibility | All cognitive mode changes must be stated and justified |

Opaque cognition fails.  
Silent reasoning paths are **non-compliant**.

---

## 5 · Uncertainty Tiers

Every AxoDen output receives one of four trust labels:

| Tier | Meaning |
|---|---|
Verified | Highly constrained and validated |
Supported | Evidence aligned, uncertainty acceptable |
Hypothesis | Tentative, exploratory, traceable uncertainty |
Speculative | Partial view or resource abort; explicitly flagged |

Confidence must always be expressed **with trace and justification**.

---

## 6 · Minimal Cognitive Trace Structure

**Every reasoning process emits a trace**, including:

- Current C4 values
- Load level
- Decision points
- Mode changes
- High-level evidence indicators
- Uncertainty rationale
- Transformation provenance
- Resource or entropy context (if relevant)

The trace format stays model-agnostic and domain-neutral.

---

## 7 · Verification & Governance

C4 outputs must pass structured review gates:

- Is the cognitive trace present?
- Is uncertainty explicitly surfaced?
- Are assumptions and transformations declared?
- Were complexity and resource budgets respected?
- Are mode changes explainable and visible?

If any gate fails → reject or degrade output.

---

## 8 · Relationship to Helix⁴

C4 connects the Helix⁴ pillars:

| Pillar | Contribution |
|---|---|
Physics | Defines load, feasibility, resource constraints |
Maths | Defines invariants and admissible transformations |
Cognition | Measures introspection & uncertainty |
Engineering | Implements trace, modes, and validation |

Cognition is the **bridge** between structure and behavior.

---

## Scope & Boundaries

C4 is **not** psychology, emotion, or personality profiling.  
It is a **structural introspection layer** for computational reasoning.

Proprietary mathematical mappings and functions are **intentionally omitted**.
